# Galileo Protocol

Galileo Protocol aims to create a world where everything gets tokenised. A world where valuables you own transfer freely & seamlessly in a peer-to-peer, fractionalised, and decentralised yet regulatory-compliant manner.
Galileo Network enables luxury brands to combat counterfeiting by accompanying their authentic, original, high-value, and quality products with immutable pNFTs, proving their ownership, condition, and origin on the blockchain.

## Vision

In the coming decade, most of the physical world will get tokenised. Tokenisation is inevitable at this point, and Galileo will do its part by providing retail and businesses with services facilitating this (r)evolution.
Our dream is to level the economic playing field through the tokenisation and fractionalisation of assets. This is only the beginning. The perception of value and the distribution thereof will evolve dramatically. Galileo leads the way.
